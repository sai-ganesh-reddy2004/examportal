I will give u the instructions u need to create a front end using angular 

the first there will be one page before login, the page is about the exam portal so there shoud be an about information
in the prelogin page, on the top right there should be login or registration buttons which will redirect to the login
page and the back ground of prelogin page will have a boy writing exam.

and when the user clicks that register page it will redirect to the registration page and then there will be a simple
page which will have 4 fields in the centre 1.username 2.email 3.password 4.confirmpassword. and at the bottom of these 
fields have one line "account already exists?"and there will be word "login" and if login is clicked the login page will
be opened. 

when login is clicked in the prelogin page then the login page will be opened it will be similar to the register page 
but the fields will be only email and the password. at bottom one line "have no account?" and a word "register".when this
is clicked then register page will be opened.
